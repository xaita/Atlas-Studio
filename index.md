# Windjammers
Windjammers is a sports arcade game developed by Data East in 1994 for SNK’s Neo Geo. It can be seen a lot of similarities with Pong or Air Hockey, where the players shoot the disc to the goal zone of the opponent. The game can be played against another player or the computer.

The player choose from six playable characters, each with their own speed/power and specials. Players maneuver around their respective sides of the court in any of the eight cardinal directions. They must attack the oponent side with different types of attacks and try to defend from the oponents attacks. There are yellow zones, worth 3 points and red zones, worth 5 points, if the player fails to catch the disk this is considered as a "miss" and gives 2 points to the oponent.

_For this project we divided the work to do with the group Piojo Games who did the same videogame. They did/search for some sprites/audios and us the rest of them. Then we share what we find between the two groups. Also, checkout his GitHub too!: [Piojo Games](https://github.com/PauM4/Windjammers)_

_Arcade_

The arcade has a [memory card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_card) system where the player can save the game to return later and have the same progress as before.

The original specification for a ROM size is up to 330 megabits, later the original [ROM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-only_memory) size was enhanced on cartridges with blank switching memory technology, increasing the size up to 716 [megabits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megabit).

In terms of the specifications, Neo Geo main [CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit) was a [Motorola 68000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68000) 12 MHz and the CPU [coprocessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprocessor) was [Zilog Z80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80) 4 MHz. The memory was composed of a RAM of 214 KB of SRAM, the Main 68000 [RAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory) with 64 KB, the Video RAM with 84 KB, a Z80 sound RAM with 2KB SRAM and a Battery-backup save [NVRAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-volatile_random-access_memory) with 64 KB [SRAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_random-access_memory). On board ROM had 512 KB SRAM composed of a Zoom look-up table of 128 KB, a Fix layer graphics of 128 KB, a Z80 sound of 128 KB and a 68000 BIOS of 128 KB. The GPU was a [SNK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNK) [LSPC2-A2](https://wiki.neogeodev.org/index.php?title=LSPC2-A2) of 24 MHz, the graphics data bus was 24-bit with a display resolution of 320x224px and a color palette of 65536. The sound was the [Yamaha YM2610](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_YM2610) sound chip, which gave the system 15 channels of sound. For the power it used a DC 5 V (in the older systems) and a DC 9 V adapter (in the newer versions).

The game was released to operate in the arcade Neo Geo. The hardware of such a machine was an evolution of an older SNK/Alpha Denshi M68000 arcade platform used in 1987. The hardware was mainly developed by [Alpha Denshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADK_(company))’s Eji Fukatsu, adding [sprite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(computer_graphics)) scaling through the use of a scaling table stored in the ROM as well as support for much bigger data and better sound.

This arcade was announced and demonstrated on January 31, 1990, in Osaka, Japan. In this exhibition SNK showed several games, including [NAM-1975](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAM-1975), [Magician Lord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magician_Lord), [Top Players Golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Player%27s_Golf) among others.

In the US, the console inicial price was planned to be $599 and to include two joysticks and a game, either [Baseball Stars Professional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_Stars_Professional) or NAM-1975. However, the price was increased and finally was launched at $649.99 (equivalent to $1235 in 2020)  and debuted as the Gold System, later it was packaged with Magician Lord and [Fatal Fury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_Fury). The Silver System launched at $399.99, included one joystick and no game in the pack. 
The Neo Geo was a worldwide commercial success upon release in arcades, becoming one of the highest-earning machines at various arcades across markets such as North American and Australian in 1990.
