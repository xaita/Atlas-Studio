# ATLAS STUDIOS: PROJECT 1- WINDJAMMERS

***

# The project

This project is a replica of the windjammers game (the arcade version) in honour to the game.
It was developed by Atlas Studio, five students from UPC-CITM from Terrassa, Spain.

# About our game

Windjammers is a sports arcade game developed by Data East in 1994 for SNKâ€™s Neo Geo. It can be seen a lot of similarities with Pong or Air Hockey, where the players shoot the disc to the goal zone of the opponent. The game can be played against another player or the computer.

In our tribute version of this game, there is only the gamemode player Vs player, which are allowed to choose from 3 different characters and 3 different maps. 
The objective of this game is to make the disk enter the enemy's goal and make as much points as you can in order to win the match. The first player to win 2 sets wins the match.
