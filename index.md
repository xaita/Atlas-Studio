# ATLAS STUDIOS: PROJECT 1- WINDJAMMERS

***

#The project

This project is a replica of the windjammers game (the arcade version) in honour to the game.
It was developed by Atlas Studio, five students from UPC-CITM from Terrassa, Spain.

# About our game

Windjammers is a sports arcade game developed by Data East in 1994 for SNK’s Neo Geo. It can be seen a lot of similarities with Pong or Air Hockey, where the players shoot the disc to the goal zone of the opponent. The game can be played against another player or the computer.

In our tribute version of this game, there is only the gamemode player Vs player, which are allowed to choose from 3 different characters and 3 different maps. 
The objective of this game is to make the disk enter the enemy's goal and make as much points as you can in order to win the match. The first player to win 2 sets wins the match.

#Controls

## Basics

Windjammers is controlled with only two buttons and the standard fighting game eight direction joystick. The A button can throw the disc, block an incoming disc, and make your character dash when they are not holding a disc. The B button lobs the disc. It does nothing when your character is not holding a disc.Directions are notated using numpad notation, which uses numbers to describe directions in accordance to their location on a numpad.

## Movement

- *Move* - hold any of the eight directions on the control stick to move in that direction.

- *Sliding/Dashing* - when your character is not holding the disc, press the **A** button while holding a direction on the control stick to dash. Holding the A button will cause your character to dash longer distances.

## Simple Mechanics

- *Catch a disc* - simply move into a disc's path to catch it. Your character will catch it automatically. Throw a straight shot - after catching the disc, press A to throw the disc in a straight shot. Holding the stick forward or backward will throw the disc straight directly in front of the character; they are the same shot.


- *Throw a curved shot* - after catching the disc, perform a directional curve, then press A to throw the disc in a curved shot. Each character has  a unique set of curves.

- *Throw a lob* - after catching the disc , press B to toss the disc into a targeted lob.

- *Block a shot* - Or "toss", it happens when you press A without holding any direction.

- *Moving Block* - When your character is not holding the disc and is standing still, tap the A button and then hold a direction on the control stick. Instead of a full dash, your character should perform a mini-dash that also blocks a shot.

## Super Mechanics

- *Reversal*-As with supersonic shots, with the correct timing (depending on the characters and the situation) you can send a super attack back to your opponent. But if you miss the time window you will end up being pushed back into your own score zone...

Super customs can be returned as super customs, super spins or super lobs.
Super spins and super lobs can only be returned as either super spins or super lobs.

- *Throw a custom super shot* –Each character has a unique super attack we call "super custom". To release a super custom, just press A after your character has finished charging. You can choose whether it will start by going up (default) or down with the stick. Just as regular throws, the quicker you launch a super custom, the faster it'll go. If your opponent manages to make a reversal attack when receiving your super custom they will send your character's custom move back at you and not their own super custom.

- *Throw a super spin shot* –To release a super spin, do a curved shot motion after you're done charging and press A. Depending on the motion, the disc will start spiraling either towards the edges of the stage or its center. And just as regular throws, the quicker you launch a super spin, the faster it'll go.

- *Throw a super lob* – Also called "hammer throw". The frisbee goes very high in the sky and continues its course on the ground by rolling on the side until it scores (or gets caught). Like the regular lob shot, the quicker you press B after charging, the farther it will go.
