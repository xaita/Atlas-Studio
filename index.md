# ATLAS STUDIOS: PROJECT 1- WINDJAMMERS

***

# The project

This project is a replica of the windjammers game (the arcade version) in honour to the game.
It was developed by Atlas Studio, five students from UPC-CITM from Terrassa, Spain.

# About our game

Windjammers is a sports arcade game developed by Data East in 1994 for SNK’s Neo Geo. It can be seen a lot of similarities with Pong or Air Hockey, where the players shoot the disc to the goal zone of the opponent. The game can be played against another player or the computer.

In our tribute version of this game, there is only the gamemode player Vs player, which are allowed to choose from 3 different characters and 3 different maps. 
The objective of this game is to make the disk enter the enemy's goal and make as much points as you can in order to win the match. The first player to win 2 sets wins the match.

- Throw Disk: To throw the disk press C (player 1) or O (player 2) while holding it.
- Block Disk: To block an upcoming disk, hold C (player 1) or O (Player 2) before it arrives to you, it will make the disk go flying.
- Disk Lob: To make a lob, press V (player 1) or P (player 2).
- Targeted throw: While holding the disk, combine the movement keys to direct your throw.
- Dash: While not holding the disk, press the throwing button to perform a dash.


   
## Super Mechanics

To throw a Super Shot, first you need to block the disk and when the disk comes down, press the throwing button to release it.

- *Throw a super spin shot* –To release a super spin, do a curved shot motion after you're done charging and press A. Depending on the motion, the disc will start spiraling either towards the edges of the stage or its center. And just as regular throws, the quicker you launch a super spin, the faster it'll go.

- *Throw a super lob* – Also called "hammer throw". The frisbee goes very high in the sky and continues its course on the ground by rolling on the side until it scores (or gets caught). Like the regular lob shot, the quicker you press B after charging, the farther it will go.
