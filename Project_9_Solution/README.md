Windjammers is a sports arcade game developed by Data East in 1994 for SNK’s Neo Geo. It can be seen a lot of similaritieswith Pong or Air Hockey, 
where the players shoot the disc to the goal zone of the opponent. The game can be played against another player or the computer.

The player choose from six playable characters, each with their own speed/power and specials. 
Players maneuver around their respective sides of the court in any of the eight cardinal directions. 
They must attack the oponent side with different types of attacks and try to defend from the oponents attacks. 
There are yellow zones, worth 3 points and red zones, worth 5 points, 
if the player fails to catch the disk this is considered as a "miss" and gives 2 points to the oponent.
